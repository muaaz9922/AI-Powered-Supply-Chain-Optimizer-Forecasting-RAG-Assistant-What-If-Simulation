# AI-Powered-Supply-Chain-Optimizer-Forecasting-RAG-Assistant-What-If-Simulation
A fully integrated AI supply chain system combining predictive forecasting, risk simulation, and a RAG-powered enterprise knowledge agent. Built with Groq LLMs, FAISS vector search, and time-series modelling. Optimized for real industry workflows.

# 🚢 AI-Powered Supply Chain Optimizer  
### Forecasting • What-If Simulation • RAG Knowledge Agent • Groq LLM

This project is an end-to-end, production-grade **AI Supply Chain Intelligence System** that integrates:

✅ **Time-series forecasting** for demand, inventory, & shipment volumes  
✅ **Monte-Carlo what-if risk simulations** for delays, disruptions, and volatility  
✅ **RAG-enabled Supply Chain Agent** that can answer natural questions using internal data  
✅ **Fast vector search (FAISS)** + **HuggingFace embeddings**  
✅ **Groq LLM reasoning** for instant, enterprise-grade insights  
✅ **Beautiful visualizations** and industry-ready modeling

Built fully in **Google Colab** with the latest versions of LangChain, FAISS, Groq SDK, and forecasting libraries — no version conflicts, beginner-friendly, and stunningly visual.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project mirrors how real companies build AI systems for supply chain:

### 🔹 1. **Data Simulation / Ingestion**
- Generates synthetic purchase orders  
- Shipment logs  
- Supplier reliability trends  
- Market factors (demand, delays, cost volatility)

### 🔹 2. **Time-Series Forecasting**
Using:
- Prophet / ARIMA style forecasting  
- 12-month forward projections  
- Visual trend plots (demand, delays, shipments)

### 🔹 3. **Monte Carlo Risk Simulations**
Simulates:
- Ports delays  
- Supplier disruptions  
- Inventory stockouts  
- Reliability dips  

Outputs:
- Probability distributions  
- Risk heatmaps  
- Expected loss scenarios  

### 🔹 4. **Enterprise RAG Agent**
A private knowledge assistant that:
- Ingests internal documents (reports, logs, SOPs)  
- Splits data into smart chunks  
- Embeds using **sentence-transformers**  
- Stores vectors in **FAISS DB**  
- Answers questions using **Groq LLM**  
- Provides **citations** from your internal data  

### Example questions:
> “Which suppliers have rising delay risk this quarter?”  
> “Summarize the Dubai port disruptions.”  
> “How will Supplier 3 delays affect inventory in 30 days?”  
> “What are the top 3 procurement risks based on internal documents?”

## 🌟 Why This Project Matters

This combines **three AI disciplines** into one system:

- **Predictive AI** (forecasts & simulations)  
- **Generative AI** (LLM reasoning)  
- **Retrieval AI** (knowledge from your own company data)  

Exactly what modern companies want from an AI engineer.

If you're applying for:
- Data Scientist  
- AI Engineer  
- Supply Chain Analyst  
- ML Engineer  

This project is a *portfolio killer*.
